					East, as well as the essence of both <br />

					<b>ALZHIR Museum</b> which is a
					<b
						>Memorial Museum of Victims of Political Repressions and
						Totalitarianism</b
					>
					is situated about 30kms outside Astana and is worth a visit. If

					<b>The Korgalzhyn Nature Reserve</b> is a wetland paradise about 160
					kms north west of Astana in the very <br />
					heart of Kazakhstan. It is located at the crossroads of two migration
					routes. These wetlands act as a <br />
					giant motor junction service station for birds. The area, most of
					which is protected, is home to the <br />
					world’s most northerly population of pink flamingos. Other notable
					residents include pelicans, cranes <br />
					and a variety of birds of prey. Spring and summer (mid April to
					September) provide the best <br />
					opportunity to see these birds. Flamingos should be resident during
					the whole of this period. For a <br />
					fortnight at the end of April and the start of May, the steppe bursts
					into colors as the tulips come into <br />
					bloom. In the winter months ice fishing is popular.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Borovoe</b>. About a 3 hour drive north of the city lays the
					attractive resort of Borovoe. It is a combination <br />
					of mountains, forests, rocks, pine and deciduous forests and lakes.

					continental with hot summers and severe winters. The resort is very
					popular with locals and the hotels <br />
					which are expensive tend to be fully booked during the summer months.
					There are a range of leisure <br />
					facilities, cafes and restaurants available. It would be a great place
					to spenв some time during <br />
					summer. In winter the resort offers ice skating, skiing, horse riding

				<h3 class="school">Story of Terra Education</h3>
				<p><b>Dear students,</b></p>
				<p>
					My name is Victoria Ushakova, a founder of Terra Education language
					school. Being a language enthusiast and educator, I have a deep
					passion for languages and the cultures that they represent. I believe
					that learning a new language is not just about mastering a set of
					grammar rules or vocabulary, but also about immersing oneself in the
					culture and developing a deep understanding of the people who speak
					that language.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a need for a language school that offered a unique approach
					to language learning, one that was focused on creating a multilingual
					community and providing cultural immersion opportunities to its
					students. To bring this vision to life, Terra Education team
					established a language school that was different from the traditional
					language schools in the area.
				</p>
				<p>
					The language school was designed to offer high-quality language
					courses that were tailored to meet the needs and goals of each
					individual student. Terra Education team of experienced language
					teachers were carefully selected for their expertise and their ability
					to create a warm and friendly learning environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Terra Education also aimed to create a multilingual community where
					students from different backgrounds and cultures could come together
					to learn and share their experiences. This was achieved by offering
					courses in a variety of languages, as well as hosting cultural events
					and activities that allowed students to immerse themselves in the
					language and culture they were studying.
				</p>
				<p>
					To further enhance the cultural immersion experience, Terra Education
					also provides opportunities for students to participate in Russian
					language programs, homestays with local families, and cultural
					excursions to nearby attractions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over time, Terra Education language school became known for its unique
					approach to language learning, its focus on creating a multilingual
					community, and its warm and friendly environment. It attracts students
					from all over the world who are looking for a truly immersive and
					personalized language learning experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, Terra Education language school continues to thrive, offering a
					wide range of language courses, cultural activities, and immersion
					opportunities to students of all ages and backgrounds.

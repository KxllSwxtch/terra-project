			<h3>Homestay</h3>

				<b><u> Homestay + Intensive courses (B1, B2, C1)</u></b>
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Our Russian courses are perfect for people, learning the language for
			work, for study or simply for personal interest. As they are designed for
			everyone who wants to improve fluency and accuracy in Russian.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the best ways to understand the local culture is to stay with one
			of our homestay families. Staying in a homestay gives you a unique view of
			Russian speaking family life, the way that we communicate, the topics we
			talk about and Kazakh culture!
		</p>
		<p>
			All our host families like to talk, share, and exchange. Our families are
			aware that you come to Kazakhstan to improve your Russian, and therefore
			that it is important for you to communicate in Russian, whatever your
			level may be.
		</p>
		<p>
			All our host families have been selected for accommodation quality and
			commitment. They are always happy to share their culture and way of life
			with our participants. Families always host our participants at clean and
			comfortable accommodation. All accommodations are located in safe
			neighborhoods.
		</p>
		<p>Host families provide:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An accommodation in a private room.</li>
			<li>Only one student per family.</li>
			<li>Wi-Fi internet access in all our host families.</li>
			<li>Taxi transfers included from/to the airport.</li>
			<li>An apartment key provided upon arrival</li>
			<li>Desk, chair, desk lamp, dresser</li>
			<li>
				Breakfast and evening dinner on weekdays. 3 meals per day on weekend
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We select only families motivated to exchange with foreigners, ready to
			spend time with you and share their daily lives. Our families are not only
			a place where you spend the night, but above all a place where you
			communicate, meet Russian speakers and practice the language. We know each
			family personally and we visit them regularly. We have an official
			contract with each family. All host families own apartments and do not
			rent out a room to anyone at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you fill in your application, please mention your preferences so that
			we can provide you with the best option for your stay. The sooner you
			register; the sooner we will start looking for the best homestay option
			available for you. We want your homestay experience to be as best as
			possible.

		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>Testimonial 1</b></p>
		<p>
			"I had the pleasure of staying with an incredible Nadezhda’s family during
			my Russian immersion course, and it was truly an unforgettable experience.
			From the moment I arrived, I was welcomed with open arms and made to feel
			like a part of the family. The warm and friendly atmosphere she and her
			family created in their home made it easy for me to feel comfortable and
			at ease, even though I was far from home.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not only did my host family provide a welcoming home environment, but they
			also went above and beyond to help me with my Russian language studies.
			Nadezhda and her husband were patient and understanding as I struggled to
			learn the language, and were always there to offer guidance and support.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks to their kindness and expertise, my language skills improved
			tremendously during my stay. I cannot express my gratitude enough for the
			invaluable experience that they provided me with. I would highly recommend
			this host family to anyone looking for a friendly and immersive experience
			while studying Russian abroad." (Phill Clarke, the UK)
		</p>

		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>Testimonial 2 </b></p>
		<p>
			"I had a Russian immersion course in Astana, Kazakhstan and it was an
			incredible experience. The immersive environment that was created in the
			course was amazing. Everywhere I went, everyone spoke authentic Russian,
			which provided me with an opportunity to improve my language skills and
			confidence in using the language.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Russian immersion course itself was challenging, but also very
			rewarding. Terra’s teachers were excellent, using a variety of teaching
			methods to help me improve my speaking, listening, reading, and writing
			skills. They were patient and understanding, making sure that I understood
			the material before moving on to the next lesson.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, I highly recommend this Russian immersion course in Terra
			Education Language School. The opportunity to live in a Russian-speaking
			environment and learn from excellent teachers was invaluable, and it was
			an experience that I will never forget." (Daniel Miller, the USA)
		</p>

		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>Testimonial 3 </b></p>
		<p>
			"Anna’s family that I stayed with was incredibly welcoming and friendly,
			and they provided a comfortable home-away-from-home during my stay.
			Everyone was patient with me as I struggled to improve my Russian language
			skills, and the family was always happy to answer my questions and help me
			practice.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the language course, I was also able to enjoy the rich
			cultural entertainment that Astana had to offer. The theater, opera, and
			ballet performances were truly world-class, and I felt lucky to have the
			opportunity to experience them firsthand. The museums were also
			incredible, providing a fascinating glimpse into Kazakh history and
			culture.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would highly recommend this immersion Russian course in Terra Education
			to anyone looking for a safe and friendly environment in which to improve
			their language skills. It was an experience that I will always cherish,
			and I am grateful for the memories that I made during my stay." (Olivia
			Mei, Canada)

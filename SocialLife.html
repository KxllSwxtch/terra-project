		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>Receptions</b></p>
		<p>
			The atmosphere at Terra Education is described as warm, welcoming, and
			full of positivity. This is exemplified by a conversation between a little
			student and a teacher, where the student noticed that everyone was smiling
			and asked why. The teacher responded by saying that it was because
			everyone was happy in our school. The staff at Terra Education is known
			for their caring, loving, and supportive nature, not just towards each
			other, but also towards their students, partners, and friends. This
			positive energy is reflected in their enjoyment of work and their
			willingness to spend their free time together, exploring new places,
			hobbies, and activities. Students call this energy "Magic of Terra
			Education".

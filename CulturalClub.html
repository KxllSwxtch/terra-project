		<!-- 8. Cultural club    -->
		<h3 class="aboutAstana">Cultural Club</h3>
		<p>
			One day, our team decided to form a cultural club with the aim of creating
			a community where both locals and foreigners could come together to
			explore the rich heritage of the region. They called it the "Cultural
			Club", inspired by the idea of preserving and celebrating the cultural
			heritage of Kazakhstan.
		</p>

		<!-- Maslenitsa -->
		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>Nauryz and Maslenitsa</b></p>
		<p>
			The club's first event was a joint celebration of two important holidays
			in the region: Maslenitsa, a Russian holiday that marks the end of winter
			and the beginning of spring, and Nauryz, a Kazakh holiday that celebrates
			the spring equinox and the start of a new year.
		</p>
		<p>
			The members of the club came together to organize a festival that
			showcased the unique customs and traditions of both cultures. They set up
			booths where people could learn how to make traditional Kazakh and Russian
			dishes, try on traditional clothing, and learn about the history and
			significance of the holidays.
		</p>
		<p>
			The event was a huge success, drawing in not just expats but also local
			residents who were eager to learn about the cultures of their neighbors.
			It was clear that there was a strong desire for more events like this in
			the community.

		<!-- 8.2 New Year  (photo) -->
		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>New year</b></p>
		<p>
			Our Cultural Club organized a New Year celebration that brought together
			both expats and local people to ring in the new year in a festive and fun
			way. The event took place in our school, and was open to everyone who
			wanted to join in on the celebration.
		</p>
		<p>
			As guests arrived, they were greeted by the festive decorations and the
			sounds of traditional New Year's music. They were also welcomed by Father
			Frost and his granddaughter, the Snow Maiden, who gave out gifts to all
			the guests.The guests were divided into two teams and participated in a
			variety of games and activities. They played a New Year's quiz, where they
			answered questions about local traditions and customs related to the
			holiday. They also played a game of charades, where they had to act out
			different New Year's-themed words and phrases.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, there was a fortune-telling station where guests could learn
			about what the coming year had in store for them. This was a popular
			attraction, as many people were eager to find out what the future
			held.Throughout the evening, guests enjoyed a variety of treats, including
			traditional holiday sweets and snacks. There were also drinks and
			refreshments available for everyone to enjoy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The New Year celebration was a testament to the power of community and the
			importance of coming together to celebrate our shared traditions and
			values.

		<!-- 8.3 Russian cuisine  (photo) -->
		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>Russian cuisine</b></p>
		<p>
			The Cultural Club organized an event to introduce expats to the delicious
			and diverse world of Russian cuisine. The event took place in our school,
			where guests were treated to a feast of traditional Russian dishes.
		</p>
		<p>
			To make the event more interactive, the guests were invited to participate
			in a game where they would try to guess the name of each dish and its
			ingredients while being blindfolded. This was a fun way for the guests to
			experience Russian cuisine and learn about the different ingredients used
			in each dish.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the guests sampled the different dishes, they compared them to the
			cuisine of their own countries and shared stories about the similarities
			and differences between the two. This led to lively conversations and a
			deeper appreciation for the diversity of food cultures around the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the game, the guests shared their own traditional dishes with
			everyone else. This was a great opportunity for everyone to taste and
			learn about the different foods and flavors from around the world. The
			guests also exchanged stories, deepening their understanding of each
			other's cultures.

		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>Russian wedding</b></p>
		<p>
			Once we organized a Russian wedding event to showcase the rich cultural
			traditions of the Russian-speaking community. The event featured a full
			wedding ceremony, complete with a bride and groom, family members, and
			friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			To make the event more authentic, Terra Education invited two friends,
			Mario and Marina, who had been happily married for many years, to play the
			roles of the bride and groom. They both looked stunning in their wedding
			outfits and enjoyed the attention and festivities.The other foreign
			students were also invited to participate in the wedding by playing the
			roles of family members and friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			The wedding ceremony included all of the traditional elements of a Russian
			wedding, including a ransom for the bride, the civil wedding ceremony, the
			wedding cake, and various games for the guests to enjoy. The guests also
			had the opportunity to learn about the different traditions and customs
			associated with a Russian wedding, which helped to deepen their

			Soviet quest was a unique event that gave foreigners a taste of life in

			simulated life in the Soviet Union.

			Each participant was given a list of tasks to complete, which included
			getting ID documents, dealing with Soviet police, buying necessary items,
			and finding services. The participants were required to complete the tasks
			in a specific order, and they had to do so within a certain time frame.
			The challenges were designed to be difficult and simulate the hardships
			that people faced in the Soviet era, such as long lines, shortages of
			goods, and bureaucratic red tape.

			life was like in the Soviet era. It was a fun and engaging way to learn

		<p class="aboutAstana"><b>Travel around the world</b></p>
		<p>
			There was an interactive event that allowed participants to explore the
			culture and traditions of five different countries. The event was designed
			to be educational and engaging, with participants divided into two teams
			and "flying" to different countries throughout the course of the event.
		</p>
		<p>
			To start the event, participants were seated in an area designed to look
			like an airplane, complete with cabin crew members dressed in traditional
			costumes of the five countries that would be visited. The first activity
			involved teams trying to guess different traditions from each country,
			with one team providing clues while the other team guessed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, the participants played a game called "Which country am I from?",
			where participants had to guess the country of origin of different items
			such as food, clothing, and musical instruments. This game helped
			participants learn more about the unique features and characteristics of
			each country.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another game involved drawing popular landmarks or sights from the five
			countries, with each team member drawing one aspect of the sight and then
			passing it onto the next person. The final participant had to identify the
			sight and name the country it belonged to.

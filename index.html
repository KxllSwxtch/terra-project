					I am Dennis Verhagen, I am Dutch and I started Russian lessons at
					Terra Education 3 times a week in September 2020. What was really
					important to me in the beginning was that I would enjoy learning this
					new language. And that's exactly what I got from my teacher Aina. She
					also adapted my lessons from the beginning to what I needed in
					everyday life, which was very helpful.

					As a language student new to Kazakhstan I can highly recommend Terra!
					Everything is absolutely awesome.

				<p>
					Everyone is so helpful. and the teachers are fantastic with skills and
					experience, a dynamic and fun approach to language learning, and with
					an authentic appreciation of local cultures. In addition to formal
					classroom instruction there are a lot of activities organized in a
					happy friendly environment. You will make valued friendships and be
					talking like a native in no time. All together, it makes for the best
					language learning experience I've ever had. Terra is a family; you
					will feel welcomed from the beginning to the end!

					My experience with Terra has been nothing less than truly pleasurable

					the teachers and the staff possess , or the level of professionalism
					all members of Terra showcase is truly admirable.

					I had moved to Astana, Kazakhstan as a diplomatic dependent and had
					been studying Russian Language at TERRA EDUCATION since October 2021
					with Elena who is one of the many well accredited professional
					teachers Terra has to offer. Personally, my previous experience with
					the Russian language made me believe that learning Russian would only
					remain a wish for me and made me very shy . However, since I started
					studying at Terra the more lessons I took the more and more confident
					I became in my ability to communicate, read and write in Russian. The
					fear I had of making mistakes in Russian was not only welcomed but
					also overcome with lots of practice. I’m nowhere near fluent in
					Russian however Elena strategically taught me the most important parts
					of both Russian grammar and basics so I can talk to all the locals and
					feel comfortable with this once impossible language. Its my belief
					that with prolonged lessons at Terra I could continue improving my
					Russian to one day reach a level of fluency that I can be proud of.
					Terra has a special place in my heart. It was not only the place where
					I started my journey to learning Russian language but also where I
					learned how sweet and comforting the Kazakh people, especially the
					teachers, can be.Terras teachers understand your struggles and help
					you surpass them whether you're really busy or you have some time on
					your hand i highly recommend you take lessons with one of the teachers
					at Terra it's truly an unforgettable experience that everyone should
					indulge in.

					I'm a diplomatic dependant for Pakistan Embassy Astana, I moved to
					Kazakhstan Astana in September 2021 and started my Russian language
					journey for the first time in October 2021 with my older sister Sana.
					We both took regular lessons with Elena for the Russian language and
					both had a great experience. Studying at Terra was not only
					comfortable but very beneficial for me. I used to shut down or shy
					away when someone spoke Russian to me or I would rely on my sister for
					assistance but neither her nor I had a good enough level to understand
					anything that the people were saying but over time with regular
					lessons with Terra we both increased our knowledge in the Russian
					language. I find the level of professionalism and respect the members
					of Terra treat you with is truly remarkable; it's one of the reasons I
					felt so comfortable here. I continued my studies at Terra for almost 3
					years and saw good improvement.

					I took Russian classes with Terra Education during my assignment at
					the EU Delegation in Astana 2012-14. The level of professionalism was
					high, from the administrative aspects to the teaching. Besides regular
					private classes the school also organized Russian Clubs where the
					students could meet and socialize with each other and the teachers,
					fun combined with learning. I have excellent memories from that time
					and my Russian skills improved considerably. Highly recommended.

					I have been learning Russian and Kazakh for years several times a week

					Classes are very well structured and it is never boring! After the end
					of my diplomatic term in Astana, I continue now getting classes via
					skype and I am looking forward to further improvement.
